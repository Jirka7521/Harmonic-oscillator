# Harmonic Oscillator Simulation

This project is a physics simulation developed for a class at the Czech Technical University (CTU). It demonstrates the harmonic motion of a pendulum using the small-angle approximation.

## Features
- Simulates the motion of a pendulum under the influence of gravity.
- Adjustable parameters:
  - Pendulum length
  - Mass
  - Initial
